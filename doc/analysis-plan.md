# Possible analyses
-Theoretical model of predator and prey sizes at different lattitudes 
-linear models for predator and prey seperatley, predicting body size based on temperature, lattitude, depth and any combination of these. 
-Linear model to test for changes in diversity of taxa based on lattitude
-Spatially explicit species distribution model 
- Correlation analysis and possible PCA using related traits to see if lattitude predicts multiple traits/combinations of traits. 

AND MANY MORE (maybe)


# Possible results
- Predator and prey will differ in the influence of lattitude or temperature on size 
- Bigger predators at higher lattiutdes. 
- Higher diversity near tropics and equator 
- Spatially explicit speceis distribution model will accurately predict ranges congruent with those in the literature. 
- Theoretical model of sizes will be able to predict average predator or prey size in a taxon at a lattitude.
