Everybody's working for the weekend, but where does this leave us...

Linear Models: 
              -Predator and Prey Lattitude, temp, depth predicting length. Predicting abundance of species? 
              -Nice simulation just for shits and giggles of simulated prey/predator at lattitudes/longitudes 
              - Spatial model
